I got in a little over my head today. I decided that I wanted to update the theme on my github pages to something more customized and since I had been to a Rails Girls event, and knew a smidgen of Ruby on Rails, I thought "Great I'll just re-theme my site and I'll be done in a jif!." That did not work as planned and I fell down the Ruby on Rails learning hole, which in itself is not bad, but not the target I have in mind for these #100daysofcode.

So I looked up the easiest way to make a blog on GitHub Pages, forked it and here we are. Although I would like to learn more about Rails in the future, and customize the theme I have on here, right now, I have to rememeber what my goals are and stay focused. I can't be the indicisive master of none.There will be time in the future to really delve into Rails.
